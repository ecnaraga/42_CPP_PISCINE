# 42_CPP_PISCINE

Goal

    - Discover and learn cpp language

Rules

    - Compile with c++ and the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror
    - C++98 library allowed only
    - STL library allowed for Module 8 and 9
    - From module 2 to 9 use the canonical form to build the classes
    - Implement functions in a cpp file (except for function template)

Module 00 => Learn how to make a .cpp and .hpp file and create classes
    
    - ex00 : write a program that takes strings in argument and write it in uppercase
    - ex01 : write a PhoneBook who can takes up to 8 contacts and implement the rule ADD (add Contact), SEARCH (search contact0 end EXIT (exit the program)
    - ex02 : write the Account.cpp file corresponding to the Account.hpp and tests.cpp files (given)

Module 01 => Learn CPP pointers and CPP references
    
    - ex00 : write a program that takes strings in argument and write it in uppercase
    - ex01 : write a PhoneBook who can takes up to 8 contacts and implement the rule ADD (add Contact), SEARCH (search contact0 end EXIT (exit the program)
    - ex02 : write the Account.cpp file corresponding to the Account.hpp and tests.cpp files (given)
